# Face Landmark Localization

Project for Pattern Recognition class at Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing, University of Zagreb.

Usage example:

`python facedetect.py` - It will run facial keypoints detection on camera

`python facedetect.py test_photo.jpg` - It will run facial keypoints detection on given photo

Used dataset: [Facial Keypoints Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/facial-keypoints-detection/data)

At the time of writing (January, 2017) our team __RASPUZ__ had 5th place on leaderbord with our model [Leaderboard](https://www.kaggle.com/c/facial-keypoints-detection/leaderboard)
